For about 7 years, I worked as a Software Engineer for various companies such as [FPT Software](https://fptsoftware.com/), [Fossil](https://fossil.com.vn/),... However, I also felt that I wanted to challenge myself more and explore new fields of technology.

That's why I decided to switch to data science, which is one of the most exciting and fast-growing fields in the world today. With a good math foundation from high school and university, I am confident I can do well in this field.

Currently, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Chidoanh](https://www.chidoanh.com) for 3 years, a company that operates in the field of marketing. With strong background in engineering and machine learning, I was usually the main architect of the services that using data from various sources for improving marketing strategies and campaigns performance.
